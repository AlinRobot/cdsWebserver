Post Secondary Electronic Standards Council - Common Data Exchange Standards

Description:

Any provider using the Common Data Services Standards (CDS) and registered in the service network could communicate directly with the appropriate exchange host for a targeted institution. The services would be 'payload agnostic' and while the immediate interest is for transcript exchange, the network could be used for the exchange of other existing or future PESC standard transactions.

As the technological landscape has evolved significantly over the years, web services standards are now available to enable automated directory lookup and efficient machine-to-machine communication in a highly secure transmission environment. The PESC CDS Task Force looks to maximize the use of this new technology to meet the emerging needs of schools, institutions, states and other service provider organizations to exchange student records, accounts and educational data.

The mission of the PESC CDS taskforce is to improve security, reliability, efficiency and speed in the transfer of all educational data types by developing an open web services network and associated standards to benefit the education of students, streamline processes for institutions, and facilitate the advancement of services offered for education.
